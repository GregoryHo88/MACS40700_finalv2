    "text": "Within the vibrant urban tapestry of Chicago, characterized by its architectural prowess and economic vitality, lies a less visible but critically important dimension of urban life: multidimensional poverty. This phenomenon extends beyond the traditional income-based assessments, to encompass a range of deprivations that affect households.\nThis commentary draws upon the latest empirical data from the ACS 5-Year Estimates for 2022, employing a methodical approach (more details here) to identify and quantify 15 distinct indicators of deprivation. These indicators span critical domains such as health, education, employment, housing, and digital accessibility, thereby offering a comprehensive view of the multifaceted nature of poverty.\nThe rationale for adopting a multidimensional perspective on poverty is grounded in contemporary scholarly discourse, which advocates for a more nuanced understanding of poverty that reflects the complex realities of urban deprivation. This approach acknowledges that poverty is not merely a lack of financial resources but encompasses a broader spectrum of unmet needs and rights, including but not limited to, adequate healthcare, quality education, stable employment, secure housing, and equitable access to information technology.\nFigure 1: Multidimensional Poverty Indicators in Chicago: A Factor Analysis\n\n\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_rect()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 presents a factor analysis of various deprivation indicators within Chicago, offering a statistical representation of the underlying structures of multidimensional poverty. Factor analysis, a complex statistical method, is employed here to identify latent variables that influence the observed data. These latent variables (or factors), represent broad domains of deprivation that are inferred from the correlations among the individual indicators. By analyzing these relationships, the figure visually conveys which aspects of urban life are most strongly associated with the different facets of poverty.\nEach bar in the graph corresponds to a specific indicator of deprivation, such as lack of health insurance or inadequate housing, and extends horizontally to signify its factor loading strength. Factor loadings are the key metrics in this analysis, reflecting the degree to which each indicator correlates with a particular factor — a higher loading indicates a stronger association. The graph is divided into distinct sections, each representing a broad dimension of deprivation, such as “Educational and Health,” “Employment & Home Condition,” “Labor & Housing Cost,” “Digital Divide,” and “School Attendance.” These broad dimensions, labeled as MRs (Multiple Regression scores), serve to categorize the indicators, revealing clusters of challenges that tend to co-occur in the urban landscape.\nHere lies a placeholder for the interactive shiny dashboard\nFigure 2: Spatial Distribution of Poverty & Latent Factors\nThe interactive dashboard presented herein is a crucial analytical instrument. It enables a nuanced exploration of poverty’s spatial distribution against the associated latent deprivation dimensions that emerged from factor analysis. You might use the dashboard to engage in a comparative spatial analysis.\nAn analysis of the Digital Divide\nIn an increasingly digital world, the divide between those with access to technology and those without is becoming a critical area of concern for urban development and social equity. This analysis seeks to explore the relationship between poverty rates and digital accessibility within Cook County, focusing specifically on households without computers and those lacking internet access.\n\n\nGetting data from the 2018-2022 5-year ACS\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations underscore a compelling narrative: areas with higher poverty rates tend to have a greater percentage of households without computers and internet access, pointing to a digital divide that mirrors socioeconomic disparities. This correlation not only highlights the barriers faced by economically disadvantaged communities in accessing digital resources but also emphasizes the critical role that digital accessibility plays in enabling opportunities for education, employment, and civic participation.\nInterestingly, from Figure 1 above, it is observed that unlike other broad factors such as ‘Employment and Home Condition’ or ‘Education and Health,’ which exhibit a higher degree of spatial clustering, the distribution of households without a computer or internet is more sporadic. This indicates a more general trend that transcends geographical and community-specific characteristics, suggesting that solutions to improve digital accessibility may need to be both broad-reaching and adaptable to local contexts. Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach, focusing on infrastructure enhancement, affordability, and digital literacy programs, to ensure equitable access to technology across all communities."

I chose to use a waffle chart to represent the demographic composition of poverty in Chicago. I think a waffle chart in particularly suited to do the job in giving the reader a sense of how the composition of poverty is divided along racial and gender lines. The reader can easily tell that there are more women in poverty, than there are men, and that Blacks comprise the largest racial component out of the total poverty headcount.\nOn Design - To ensure that the heaviest component falls to the bottom segment of the waffle, I had to aggregate and reorder each category by their relative frequencies (counts). I also thought that this would be a good opportunity to use the Okabe-Ito color scheme that is accessible to people with color vision deficiency."

I chose to use a waffle chart to represent the demographic composition of poverty in Chicago. I think a waffle chart in particularly suited to do the job in giving the reader a sense of how the composition of poverty is divided along racial and gender lines. The reader can easily tell that there are more women in poverty, than there are men, and that Blacks comprise the largest racial component out of the total poverty headcount.\nOn Design - To ensure that the heaviest component falls to the bottom segment of the waffle, I had to aggregate and reorder each category by their relative frequencies (counts). I also thought that this would be a good opportunity to use the Okabe-Ito color scheme that is accessible to people with color vision deficiency."

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nChicago is a city with a diverse demographic and economic landscape. However, it faces significant challenges in relation to poverty. This research proposal aims to unravel the layers of poverty in the city, identifying key areas of deprivation that affect households. In the final project, I wish to examine key areas of deprivation such as access to shelter, healthcare, education and other indicators of living standards.\n\n3.1.1 Research Questions\nThe analysis is guided by two research questions:\nRQ1 - What are the key demographical factors associated with poverty in Chicago?\nRQ2 - How does housing affordability impact the prevalence of poverty in Chicago?\n\n\n3.1.2 Methods\nData for this analysis was sourced from the ACS 5-Year Estimates for 2022. I’ve chosen to focus on housing accessibility for this proposal. Data on population demographics, poverty headcounts, and housing costs were extracted using the tidycensus package. The analysis focused on census tracts within Cook County to provide a more granular view of poverty in Chicago.\n\n\n3.1.3 Census API Key Configuration\nTo proceed, you must have a Census API key. Visit the Census Bureau’s website for instructions on obtaining one. (More info to get one in the main README document).\nThe following block stores your Census API key in your environment.\n\n#Uncheck and insert your API KEY\n#census_api_key(\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\", install=TRUE)"
