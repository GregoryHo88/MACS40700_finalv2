This research proposal aims to unravel the layers of poverty in the city, identifying key areas of deprivation that affect households. In the final project, I wish to examine key areas of deprivation such as access to shelter, healthcare, education and other indicators of living standards.\n\n1.1.1 Research Questions\nThe analysis is guided by two research questions:\nRQ1 - What are the key demographical factors associated with poverty in Chicago?\nRQ2 - How does housing affordability impact the prevalence of poverty in Chicago?"

Data on population demographics, poverty headcounts, and housing costs were extracted using the tidycensus package. The analysis focused on census tracts within Cook County to provide a more granular view of poverty in Chicago."
