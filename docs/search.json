This research proposal aims to unravel the layers of poverty in the city, identifying key areas of deprivation that affect households. In the final project, I wish to examine key areas of deprivation such as access to shelter, healthcare, education and other indicators of living standards.\n\n1.1.1 Research Questions\nThe analysis is guided by two research questions:\nRQ1 - What are the key demographical factors associated with poverty in Chicago?\nRQ2 - How does housing affordability impact the prevalence of poverty in Chicago?\n\n\n1.1.2 Methods\nData for this analysis was sourced from the ACS 5-Year Estimates for 2022. I’ve chosen to focus on housing accessibility for this proposal. Data on population demographics, poverty headcounts, and housing costs were extracted using the tidycensus package. The analysis focused on census tracts within Cook County to provide a more granular view of poverty in Chicago.\n\n\n1.1.3 Census API Key Configuration\nTo proceed, you must have a Census API key.

By dissecting data across various census tracts within Cook County, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and distributions of poverty, housing affordability, and demographic factors that shape the city’s landscape.

I chose to use a waffle chart to represent the demographic composition of poverty in Chicago. I think a waffle chart in particularly suited to do the job in giving the reader a sense of how the composition of poverty is divided along racial and gender lines. The reader can easily tell that there are more women in poverty, than there are men, and that Blacks comprise the largest racial component out of the total poverty headcount.\nOn Design - To ensure that the heaviest component falls to the bottom segment of the waffle, I had to aggregate and reorder each category by their relative frequencies (counts). I also thought that this would be a good opportunity to use the Okabe-Ito color scheme that is accessible to people with color vision deficiency."
